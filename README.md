## High Dimensional Visualization | Tableau 
### Example Tableau workbooks, data extracts, data sources, and map sources
*	The first step to build a tableau visualization is to connect to a data source, in tableau, data can be imported through various sources like excel, PDF or stored on server such as SQL Server, Google Analytics etc.

* Since most of the data we have nowadays is high dimensional in nature, selecting which dimensions to pit against which measures plays an important role and constitutes this step.

*	Depending on what our requirement is we need to select a view, like bar chart, heat map, pie chart, tree map, scatter plot, bubble graph etc.

*	After doing that, we can add various filters to sort through data and add colours or effects to make the important features stand out and utilize various tools tableau offers to beautify our visualization.

* Finally, we can either publish our workbook to a server or save it.
